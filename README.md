The analysis shows that urban had most drivers and sum of fares and also runs the most rides. 
However, the urban also had the lowest average fare by ride or by driver.

1. create prices vs seasons that could generate more profit for the time (last feb/early march) that the urban demand is high
2. put drivers in rotation as the rural/suburban market is almost even through out from Jan to April
3. gave urban drivers an option for un-paid vacation in early jan so that when the demand for urban is low, the company could save money instead of running an empty ride.
